# üèéÔ∏è F1 Pitstop Prediction Model

A deep learning application that predicts when Formula 1 drivers should pit during races using PyTorch and real-time race data from FastF1.

![Confusion Matrix](images/confusion_matrix_best.png)

## üìä Project Overview

This project builds a binary classification model to predict whether an F1 driver should pit in the next lap based on current race conditions. The model addresses a severely imbalanced dataset (~97% "no pit" vs ~3% "pit") using advanced techniques to achieve meaningful predictions for race strategy.

The system includes both a trained neural network model and an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time pitstop strategy recommendations.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. **Real-time F1 Data Integration**
- Uses **FastF1** library to fetch live race data from 2017-2025 seasons
- Processes telemetry including lap times, tyre age, track conditions, and positions
- Automatically handles data cleaning and feature engineering

### 2. **Advanced Model Architecture**
```python
PitstopModel:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Linear(9 ‚Üí 128) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.4)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Linear(128 ‚Üí 64) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Linear(64 ‚Üí 32) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Linear(32 ‚Üí 16) + ReLU
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Linear(16 ‚Üí 1)  # Single output for binary classification
```

### 3. **Sophisticated Feature Engineering**
- **Enhanced Feature Weighting** applied after normalization:
  ```python
  tyre_age *= 2.5      # Most critical factor for pit decisions
  lap_number *= 2.0    # Race progression importance
  position *= 1.2      # Strategic position consideration
  ```
- **MinMaxScaler**: All features normalized to [0,1] range before weighting

### Feature Engineering Pipeline
```python
# Normalization (matching prepare_dataset.py exactly)
tyre_age_normalized = tyre_age_laps / 77.0
lap_time_normalized = lap_time_seconds / 2526.25

# Feature weighting (applied after scaler)
weighted_features = scaled_features.copy()
weighted_features[3] *= 2.5  # tyre_age (most important)
weighted_features[1] *= 2.0  # lap_number
weighted_features[6] *= 1.2  # position
```

### Data Quality Assurance
